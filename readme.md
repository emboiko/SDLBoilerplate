# SDL Boilerplate

This repo is intended to make the process of getting started with [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) projects a little faster with a simple scaffold.

Instructions on how to install & link SDL can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation).

*This repo is also serving as a learning experience with using Visual Studio's integrated GUI-based Git tools*
